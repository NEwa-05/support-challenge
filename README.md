Small challenges to test support engineers

## K8s test one

First test of the K8s challenge we need to understand why the wildcard certificate generated by the gencert.sh script is not used as Traefik default certificate.

## K8s test two

My gohello app require a certificate when requested from traefik, I want to use my CA cert to validate the gohello app cert but only the insecureSkipVerify works.

## Swarm test

Traefik is not getting the configuration from my whoami apps label why?

## VM test

Traefik is not publishing my whoami app, and I want to be sure it is only available on port web.
